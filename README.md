## Food recipes

### Description
Application uses offline caching, after fetching data from an external API (Tasty from RadpidAPI in this case). Then it's just retrieved from local storage and displayed in RecyclerView.

User has a clear view of the list of all stored recipes and can mark each of them as *favorite* - which gains pernament access to them (for possible additional feature, which allows user to refresh list of recipes and fetch new, replacing previous ones).
